Hey, I'm Konstantine!

I'm a self-taught programmer, ethical hacker, and cybersecurity enthusiast. I have been tinkering with computers for as long as I can remember, and it didn't take long for me to realize it was the perfect work for me. Over the past few years, I have created and contributed to dozens of ideas that were put together as passion projects. These projects helped foster my learning of many computer science topics, such as game development, fullstack development, big data, and security, among various other fields.

Along with my own various upcoming projects and work, I participate in the [CyberPatriot](https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/) and [NSA Codebreaker Competition](https://nsa-codebreaker.org/home). I love collaborating with others, and actively volunteer to help teach students about computer science and mathematics.
